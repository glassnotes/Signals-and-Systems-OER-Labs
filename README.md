# Signals and Systems OER Labs

This repository contains a set of hands-on, guided Jupyter notebooks that we developed to teach undergraduate students topics in signals and systems for ELEC 221 at UBC.

Development of these materials was financially supported by the UBC [Open Educational Resource (OER)](https://oerfund.open.ubc.ca/) Fund Implementation Grant in 2023-24. The material was 
developed primarily by UBC undergraduate students

 * Sofiya Spolitak ([@SofiyaSp](https://github.com/SofiyaSp))
 * Sidharth Sudhir ([@sidharthsudhir-03](https://github.com/sidharthsudhir-03))

under the supervision of Profs. Olivia Di Matteo ([@glassnotes](https://github.com/glassnotes/)) and
Christos Thramboulidis ([@cthrampo](https://github.com/cthrampo)).

## Contents

This repository contains 9 hands-on labs based on a variety of topics. Learning outcomes can be found at the top of each Jupyter notebook.

 1. Introductory materials (Python, NumPy, Jupyter notebooks)
 2. Audio processing with Fourier analysis and filters (building a simple sound equalizer)
 3. Image processing (filters and effects in airport scanners)
 4. Video processing (filtering and compression in video games)
 5. Data and discrete-time signals (analyzing trends in COVID data)
 6. Up/downsampling and multiplexing (building a simulated radio)
 7. Communication systems (decoding satellite communications)
 8. Amplitude modulation (synthesizing sounds with the Karplus-Strong algorithm)
 9. Laplace transforms and control systems (building a self-regulating thermostat)
