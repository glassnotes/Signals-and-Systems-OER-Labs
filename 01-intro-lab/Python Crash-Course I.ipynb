    "\n",
    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",

    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",

    "Througout the notebook there are a few exercises for you to practice. These are marked in red boldface color as <font color='red'>**Exercise X.X.X**</font>. Try solve the exercises as you go through the notebooks. View it as an opportunity to test your understanding of the material. Ask your labmates or the TAs for help if you need to. \n",
    "\n",
